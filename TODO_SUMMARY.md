# Pending TODOs and Unimplemented Areas

A scan of inline comments surfaces the following TODO items that still need attention:

| File | Line | Note | Priority |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| mrecorder.js | 634 | TODO waiting for a `type` property to be added during recording logic. | Medium |

**Counts**
- Total TODO markers: 1
- FIXMEs/other markers: 0

These TODOs are not yet implemented; tackle them in order of user-facing impact (recorder stability first, configuration clarity second).
