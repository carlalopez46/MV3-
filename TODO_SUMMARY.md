# Pending TODOs and Unimplemented Areas

The previously tracked medium-priority TODO in `mrecorder.js` (adding a `type` property during tab update handling) has been
implemented. Navigation updates are now recorded via `chrome.tabs.onUpdated`, removing the outstanding gap in recorder
coverage.

**Counts**
- Total tracked TODO markers: 0
- FIXMEs/other markers: 0

No open TODOs remain in the actively maintained code path summarized here. Legacy source snapshots under `old_file/` still
contain TODO comments for historical reference.
