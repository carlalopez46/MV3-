# Current Known Follow-ups

After reviewing the repository notes, there are still a couple of documented TODO items that remain unresolved:

1. `mrecorder.js` has a medium-priority TODO related to adding a `type` property during recording logic to stabilize recorder output.

No additional regressions were identified in this review beyond the above documented items.
